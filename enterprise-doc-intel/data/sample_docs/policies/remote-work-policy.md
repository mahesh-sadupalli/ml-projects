# Remote Work Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for employees working remotely, ensuring productivity, security, and work-life balance across the organization.

## Eligibility
All full-time employees who have completed their probationary period (90 days) are eligible for remote work. Part-time employees may request remote work arrangements with manager approval.

## Work Schedule
- Core hours: 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM (local time) — all remote employees must be available during these hours.
- Flexible hours: Employees may adjust start and end times outside core hours with manager approval.
- Maximum remote days: Up to 3 days per week for hybrid roles, 5 days for fully remote positions.

## Equipment and Setup
The company provides:
- Laptop and necessary peripherals
- VPN access and licensed software
- Monthly stipend of €50 for home office expenses (internet, electricity)

Employees are responsible for maintaining a quiet, secure workspace suitable for professional calls.

## Communication
- Daily stand-ups via Microsoft Teams at 10:00 AM
- Slack is the primary tool for asynchronous communication
- Response time expectation: within 2 hours during core hours
- Video must be enabled during client-facing meetings

## Security Requirements
- All work must be performed on company-provided devices
- VPN must be active when accessing internal systems
- Screen lock must be enabled when stepping away
- Confidential documents must not be printed at home without authorization

## Performance Monitoring
Remote employees are evaluated based on output and deliverables, not hours logged. Managers conduct bi-weekly one-on-ones to discuss progress and challenges.

## Policy Violations
Repeated failure to meet availability expectations, security breaches, or performance issues may result in revocation of remote work privileges.
